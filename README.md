# Module-Eight
Repository for Module 8 Assignment

  The goal of this project was to take a list of purchased produce from a file and then provide a menu controlled by the user that has multiple display options for the inputted data. One of the things I did well on was the use of functions for repeated tasks. Something that could be improved would be to add more comments explaining the code making it more readable. The main part of this code that I had to look up was an efficient way to traverse the map that stored the inputted data. The usage of maps and how to traverse them in an effective mannor will be a skill that I can see being useful in future projects and course work. This program was made maintainable, readable and adaptable through the use of functions and following standard coding practices.
